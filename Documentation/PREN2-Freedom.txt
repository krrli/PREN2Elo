                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - I2C_ToF_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - I2C_ToF_MasterSendBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The slave address 
                must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, "Target 
                slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. 
                The state of transmission is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete or OnError). Data to be sent 
                are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - I2C_ToF_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes 
                inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and then receives the block of characters from the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - I2C_ToF_SelectSlaveDevice -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave, 10-bit address or general 
                call value. Any send or receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected 
                by this method. This method is available for the MASTER mode.
   - I2C_ToF_Main -This method is available only for polling mode. If interrupt service is disabled this method replaces the 
                I2C interrupt handler. This method should be called if Receive/SendBlock was invoked before in order to run the 
                reception/transmition.
